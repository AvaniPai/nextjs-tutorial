					excited to meet international students and was wondering how he can become friends with them. Shusuke periodically chimed in with a &quot;yeah!&quot; and an exuberant high-five, much to Avani&apos;s amusement.
					Avani, herself eager to make friends with local Japanese students, invited them to join her and the other exchange students for lunch later that week, and the three of them exchanged phone numbers.

					of the summer? No way! &quot;
