		<div className="container mx-auto justify-center text-pretty px-20 text-lg">
			<p className="indent-4">The &quot;Muhurtham&quot; is a wedding ceremony performed in accordance with the Hindu traditions derived from the Vedas (The Hindu Holy Scriptures).
				By performing these ancient customs, which hold great spiritual significance, Hindus believe that the marriage will be witnessed by the Gods in Heaven and the five elements of nature: Fire, Air, Water, Earth, and Sky.
				Additionally, the time at which the ceremony occurs is very important. Priests employ numerology and astrology to divine the most auspicious time (down to the hour!) for the bethroed couple to seal the knot, 
				using the bridge and groom's birth date and star formations.
				
				The ceremony is typically conducted in Sanskrit by a Hindu priest and consists of 16 common steps, however given that India is a vast and diverse country, there are many variations of the Muhurtham, each specific to the region, community, and cultures of
				the bridge and groom's families.
				Below is a description of each of the 16 steps that are most commonly found across Hindu weddings.
